Little test project that includes a netty WebSocket Client and a Akka Streams 2.0.2 WebSocket server.

In contrast to 2.0.1 connections break from time to time because the server sends a RST

see the /results folder for a good looking but broken WebSocket exchange and a tcp dump including two different
observed errors as well as one successfull case
